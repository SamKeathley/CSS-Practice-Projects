# CSS Practice Projects

CSS is easily my weakest point. Therefore, this repo contains projects that I have started for the express purpose of improving my CSS and SCSS knowledge and skills. Just trying to make my projects look better and more accessible. :thumbsup:

### Natours

- A place where you can look at and book various nature tours.
- Very SCSS heavy project that focuses on the intricacies of SCSS and how to use the BEM method.

### Trillo

- Hotel booking site.
- Focusing on how to use Flexbox properly and more practice with BEM.
